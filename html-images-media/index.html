    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p>Here is showing how images and media files work</p>
    <img src="../images/images-workouts.jpeg" alt="strong guy posing" />
    <p>
      When adding in an image you have to make sure your grabbing it from the
      right path and adding in an alt so if the image does load then there is
      something telling the user what it is.

    <h2>Videos</h2>
    <p>Here is how videos work</p>
    <iframe
      width="560"
      height="315"
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBjMf7WKXa4?si=blSXuPG196nT205R"
      title="YouTube video player"
      frameborder="0"
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
      referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
      allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    <p>
      When adding in a video you have to use the iframe and copy the embedded
      code from the video.
    </p>

    <h2>Audio</h2>
    <p>Here is how to add in auto files</p>
    <audio controls>
      <source src="../html-auidos/file_example_WAV_1MG.wav" type="audio/mpeg" />
